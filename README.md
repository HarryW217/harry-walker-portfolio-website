## What I learned

`Responsive Design`: I became more comfortable using CSS media queries and adjusting layouts to create a design that changes depended on the user's screen size. 

`JavaScript for Interactivity`: I used my strong understanding of JavaScript to create functions that may be used as a HTML script and implement interactive features. I got more practise using event listeners and manipulating the DOM so the user can switch 'about me' tabs or use a mobile side menu.
