# My Portfolio Website!

## Project Summary

Welcome to the repo for my portfolio website. This website showcases me (Harry Walker), my skills, experience, services and past coding projects. Users can also use the website to download a copy of my CV and directly contact me to make a work-related inquiry!

## Hosted Version

This website is hosted using Netlify. You can visit at this address: https://harrywalker.netlify.app/

## What I learned

`Responsive Design`: I became more comfortable using CSS media queries and adjusting layouts to create a design that changes depended on the user's screen size. 

`JavaScript for Interactivity`: I used my strong understanding of JavaScript to create functions that may be used as a HTML script and implement interactive features. I got more practise using event listeners and manipulating the DOM so the user can switch 'about me' tabs or use a mobile side menu. 

`Contact Form`: Using a script URL and adding an event listener, the website can allow users to get in contact with me, with the message being sent to an external Google Sheet. 

`External Libraries`: 'FontAwesome' icons have been used throughout this site, demonstrating to me how external libraries may be used to add visual appeal to apps I develop. 

## Instructions

Would you like to use this website as a basis for your own portfolio? Go for it!

Open your terminal and navigate to the directory you would like to keep this project in. Once you're there, enter the following command:

```
git clone (then paste the repo url here)
```

I would recommend opening the repo on VS Code and installing 'Live Server' to locally host the website and see it as you edit it.

Any questions? Drop me a message on my website's contact form!
